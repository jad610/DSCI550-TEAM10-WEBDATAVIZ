    <strong>Line Chart</strong> <br />  
    The line chart visualized the relationship between post language and location in the posts on HW2-Q3. <br /> 
    There are 25,839 rows in the dataset after data cleaning, and we chose the top 10 countries in the dataset to visualize and compare corrections with GLang_language, including en, bn, it, fr, and other. <br />  
    The X-axis shows the percentage of post-language and identified mentioned in each country/territory, and the Y-axis shows the percentage of post-language and identified each country/territory. <br />
