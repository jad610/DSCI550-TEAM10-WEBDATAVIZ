    <p>The percentage bar chart visualized the relationship between gender and location in the posts on HW2-Q1. 
       There are 16,423 rows in the dataset after data cleaning, and we chose the top 10 countries in the dataset 
       to visualize and compare corrections with gender, including male, female, and other. The X-axis shows the 
       percentage of males, females, and others in each country/territory; the Y-axis shows the percentage of gender 
       in each country/territory. </p>
